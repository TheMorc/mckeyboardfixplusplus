This repo contains the sources of Minecraft Keyboard Fix PlusPlus.

Minecraft Keyboard Fix PlusPlus is a fork of the original and lightweight
Minecraft Forge mod that fixes keyboard issues in Minecraft on LWJGL 2.

This mod is configurable with a config file to give you absolute freedom
with fixing layout problems on various keyboard layouts.

WARNING: The default config is currently set up to fix issues on the Slovak
keyboard layout. You can configure it by launching the game once with the mod
and then replacing keyCharsOriginal list with keys that you wish to be remapped.
The keyCharsRemapped list has integer values of remapped keys,
check the link below for reference as to what values to use in it.

Minecraft Keyboard Fix supports Minecraft 1.8.9, 1.9.x, 1.10.x, 1.11.x, and
1.12.x. Since the keyboard issue no longer exists since Minecraft 1.13, this
mod does not, and needs not, be ported to that version or any later version of
the game.

Should any other keyboard issue in Minecraft on GNU/Linux be discovered, code
that fixes it could be added to this mod if available.

You can build and install this mod as if you are building and installing a
common Minecraft Forge mod. If you are unfamiliar with this procedure or
encounter any problem, you can see the file INSTALL.md to learn more about the
building and installation process.

Minecraft Keyboard Fix is free software. See the file COPYING for copying
conditions.
